DAEView.

This library implements the set of functionality required to visualize
COLLADA DAE files. The library is portable and written using modern
OpenGL API (no deprecated functions are used). In addition, there is a
test application which illustrates how to use the library and is in
fact a simple COLLADA viewer.

Please refer to the https://www.gitorious.org/daeview/pages/Home for
more details about the project.

To compile, I would suggest to create the following file structure:
daeview/
  git/
  build/

Then clone the repository:
git clone git://gitorious.org/daeview/daeview.git git

Enter build/ director and run cmake as following to generate makefiles
cmake ../git
or use more interactive way by issuing:
ccmake ../git
then adjust compilation options and press 'c' as many times as
necessary and finally 'g' to generate makefiles.

Then just type make. The exectutable daeviewer file will be located in
the build/src/daeviewer and the library in build/src/collada-view .
