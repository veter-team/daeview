Collada DOM 2.2.1

Documentation is available online at
http://collada.org/mediawiki/index.php/Portal:COLLADA_DOM

Questions, bug reports and feature requests should go to our Sourceforge project
site: http://sourceforge.net/projects/collada-dom/

If you're upgrading your software from a previous release of the DOM you may be
interested in the backward compatibility page we maintain on the wiki:
http://collada.org/mediawiki/index.php/DOM_backward_compatibility

The binary packages only contain release builds. If you need to debug the DOM
you should download the source and build it on your machine. The Visual Studio
packages include debug builds because you can't link a release DOM into a debug
app with that compiler. The debug info has been stripped though to keep the
download size down.
